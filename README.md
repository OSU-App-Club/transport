Corvallis Bus Hackathon Project

During a hackathon put on by the OPAL team and the OSU app club, Team Transport created an app for Corvallis Transit users. Our goal was to create an app that provided the most relevant information while also being simple to use.  We decided to focus on making an app for the regular bus rider as OPAL determined they would be our most likely users. With that, we thought the most important information for a regular rider to know was when their bus was going to arrive at their stop. The main view of the app presents the nearby bus stops and the amount of time until that bus will be at that stop. Unlike the posted bus schedules, our app provides real-time data about when the bus will arrive.  Another feature of our app is the routes view. This allows the user to see all of the Corvallis bus routes and where they go on a map. We used the Google Maps API to show these routes and where they are in relation to a user's current location. 

Throughout the app we chose to use the colors assigned to each route by CTS in order to allow the user to quickly and easily find the information they need.
